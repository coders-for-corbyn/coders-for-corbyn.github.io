  <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
  <p>This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participants within the Coders For Labour community, as well as steps to reporting unacceptable behavior. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all and expect our code of conduct to be honored. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be expelled from the community.</p>

  <h3>Diversity Statement</h3>
  <p>We encourage everyone to participate and are committed to building a community for all. Although we will fail at times, we seek to treat everyone both as fairly and equally as possible. Whenever a participant has made a mistake, we expect them to take responsibility for it. If someone has been harmed or offended, it is our responsibility to listen carefully and respectfully, and do our best to right the wrong.
Although this list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honor diversity in age, gender, gender identity or expression, culture, ethnicity, language, national origin, political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and technical ability. We will not tolerate discrimination based on any of the protected characteristics above, including participants with disabilities.</p>
  <h3>Safe Space Policy</h3>
  <p>Coders for Labour have a safe space policy to ensure that we are able to provide an inclusive and open place for us to discuss, develop and debate ideas. In order to achieve this we have developed the following rules that will be adopted at all times:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>C4L is committed to operating as a space which is inclusive and supportive in which no forms of discrimination are tolerated. Derogatory comments relating to racism, homophobia, biphobia, sexism, transphobia, disablism or prejudice based on age, ethnicity, nationality, class, gender, gender presentation, language ability, immigration status or religious affiliation will not be tolerated. C4C has a zero tolerance policy with regard to sexual, physical or verbal harassment.</li>
    <li>Do not make assumptions about anyone’s gender, pronouns, sexual preference, abilities, ethnic identity, survivor status, or life experiences.</li>
    <li>Be prepared to challenge hateful, discriminatory, or oppressive language.If you are challenged, do not become defensive, but listen and think and learn.</li>
    <li>In the event that we host discussions or debates we will never feature all male panels. If there are two speakers at an event, one must be a woman.</li>
    <li>The organisers of an event will have both the responsibility to ensure the above is adhered to and the authority to remove any member of C4C who breaches the above or causes insult to another on the grounds of discrimination outlined above.</li>
    <li>As a group we have a duty to self police our events to ensure that organisers follow the rules above. If they are unable to we have the authority to either remove and replace the organiser or cancel the event.</li>
    <li>Active attempts will be made by all members, and especially the event host, to increase gender parity, representation and inclusion.</li>
    <li>Active attempts will be made by all members, and especially the event host, to increase representation and inclusion of BAME members.</li>
    <li>The event chair and exec members present have a responsibility to ensure individuals do not block a member's contribution to discussion or debate through interrupting, silencing, heckling or over-talking them.</li>
    <li>Members will be made aware of the complaints procedure and the safe space policy in the interests of transparency. This includes the safe space policy being highlighted at the beginning of events.</li>
    <li>Harassment, hostility and aggression will not be tolerated in any form and if we feel that you have overstepped these boundaries we will challenge this and you may be asked to leave.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Reporting Issues</h3>
  <p>If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior—or have any other concerns—please report it by contacting us via reportabuse@codersforlabour.com. All reports will be handled with discretion and anonymity if you require. In your report please include:</p>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Your contact information.</li>
    <li>Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there are additional witnesses, please include them as well. Your account of what occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing. If there is a publicly available record (e.g. slack or facebook post), please include a link.</li>
    <li>Any additional information that may be helpful.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>After filing a report, a representative will contact you personally, review the incident, follow up with any additional questions, and make a decision as to how to respond. If the person who is harassing you is part of the response team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. If the complaint originates from a member of the response team, it will be handled by a different member of the response team. We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse.</p>
